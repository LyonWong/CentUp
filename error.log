checking for libmcrypt - version >= 2.5.0... no
*** Could not run libmcrypt test program, checking why...
*** The test program compiled, but did not run. This usually means
*** that the run-time linker is not finding LIBMCRYPT or finding the wrong
*** version of LIBMCRYPT. If it is not finding LIBMCRYPT, you'll need to set your
*** LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or edit /etc/ld.so.conf to point
*** to the installed location  Also, make sure you have run ldconfig if that
*** is required on your system
***
*** If you have an old version installed, it is best to remove it, although
*** you may also be able to get things to work by modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH
***
configure: error: *** libmcrypt was not found
